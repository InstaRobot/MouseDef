MouseDef is a Mac desktop utility that lets you move and resize windows by
holding down modifier keys.

### How it works

MouseDef uses the accessibliity features in macOS in order to gain information about the cursors current position and to resolve which window is underneat the cursor in addition to setting the new position and/or size as the mouse cursor moves.

### Features

- [ ] Customizable keyboard shortcut keys
- [x] Move windows when modifier keys are active
- [x] Resize windows when modifier keys are active
- [x] Quadrant resizing
